#Core - Void Attackers
==========

Void Attackers is a clone of that classic arcade game we all know and love.


It was developed in parallel with the Core framework as both a test case and a demonstration of Core's capabilities.
As a result, the code is a mix of old and new ideas. I have yet to refactor it.


It is graphically unimpressive because I have very little artistic talent.


###Known Issues:
1. Different window sizes will cause the game to not function properly.
2. The code is a messy, inconsistent mish-mash of different ideas.
3. The program does not close if the window is closed with the X button on the top right.
4. Timing issue on different computers can cause the game to turn into a bullet-hell shooter.
5. The aliens do not move downward.

###Upcoming changes:
1. Fix game to work with any window size
2. Refactor code to be consistent and remove outdated/unnecessary things.
3. Close program when X is pressed.
4. Make consistent timing.
5. Create a .jar so that it can be launched easily.


Have fun!

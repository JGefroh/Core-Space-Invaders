#Core - Void Attackers
==========

Void Attackers is a clone of that classic arcade game we all know and love.


It was developed in parallel with the Core framework as both a test case and a demonstration of Core's capabilities.
As a result, the code is a mix of old and new ideas. I have yet to refactor it.


It is graphically unimpressive because I have very little artistic talent.


###Known Issues:
1. The code is a messy, inconsistent mish-mash of different ideas.

###Upcoming changes:
1. Refactor code to be consistent and remove outdated/unnecessary things.
2. Make consistent timing.

###Dependencies
1. [LWJGL 2.8.5](http://www.lwjgl.org)
2. [jackson 2.2.0](http://www.jackson.codehaus.org)
3. [Core 0.4.0](http://www.github.com/jgefroh/core)

Have fun!
